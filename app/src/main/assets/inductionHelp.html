<h1>Before Induction</h1>

<p>Full information on implementing the checklist can be found at this <a href ="http://www.who.int/entity/patientsafety/safesurgery/tools_resources/SSSL_Manual_finalJun08.pdf?ua=1">link,</a>
</p>
<p>
The Before Induction step requires the presence of the anestheisa provider and nursing staff, at minimum. These steps can be done all at once,or one at a time, depending on the workflow for anesthesia preparation.
</p>
<h2>Patient Confirms Identity, Site, Procedure and Consent</h2>
<p>
The checklist coordinator needs to receive verbal confirmation from the patient about their identity, the surgery planned, the site of the surgery, as well as verifying the patient's consent to the proceure. While this seems obvious, this is an effective way to prevent wrong patient, wrong site, and wrong procedure errors. If confirmation by the patient is not possible, a family member or guardian can provide confirmation. In cases where confirmation is not possible, the boxes should be left unchecked.
</p>
<h2>Site Marked or Marking Not Applicable</h2>
<p>
The checklist coordinator needs to confirm that the surgeon has marked the surgery site. The most common way to do this is with an indelible felt-tip marker. This applies in cases that involve left/right distinction (for example, hand or leg) and cases that involve multiple structures (fingers, or vertebrae, for example). Marking the site for midline or single structures, such as the thyroid or spleen, should follow local practice. Consistent marking provides a reliable backup check confirming the site and the procedure.
</p>
<h2>Anesthesia Safety Check Completed</h2>
<p>The coordinator verifies with the anesthesia provider that the anesthesia safety check is complete. The anesthesia safety check is a formal inspection of the anesthesia equipment, medications, and patient risk factors before induction. The anesthesia provider should confirm that the patient is fit for surgery. The WHO suggests the mnemonic ABCDE for the anesthesia safety check: examination of the Airway equipment, the Breathing system, suCtion, Drugs and devices, and Emergency medications, euipment and assistance.
</p>
<h2>Pulse Oximeter On Patient and Functioning</h2>
<p>The checklist coordinator confirms that the pulse oximeter has been put on the patient, and is correctly functioning. It is recommended that the pulse oximeter reading is visible to the team. Pulse oximetry is strongly recommended for safe anesthesia. If no pulse oximeter is available, delaying the surgery should be considered. In an emergency, the step may be skipped, but the box should be left unchecked.
</p>
<h2>Does the Patient Have a Known Allergy?</h2>
<p>The checklist coordinator should confirm with the anesthesia provider whether the patient has a known allergy or allergies, and if so, what they are. This step is to be completed even if the coordinator knows the answer, in order to confirm that the anesthesia provider is aware of the allergy. If the coordinator knows of an allergy that the anesthesia provider is unaware of, that information should be shared at this point.
</p>
<h2>Does the Patient Have A Difficult Airway / Aspiration Risk?</h2>
<p>The checklist coordinator should confirm that the anesthesia team has performed an objective evaluation of whether the patient has a difficult airway. This may be done in any of several ways (Mallampati score, thyromental distance, etc). The key is that an objective evaluation is performed, rather than the method used. Death due to airway difficulties under anesthesia is a risk that can be managed with foresight and planning. If there is a high risk, the anesthesia team should prepare for difficulties, perhaps by adjusting the technique, and by having emergency equipment ready. In high risk situations, an assistant should be physically present for induction.
</p>
<p>Aspiration risk should also be evaluated at this time. If aspiration risk is high, it can be managed by adjusting technique, such as rapid induction combined with cricoid pressure provided by an assistant. For patients with elevated airway or aspiration risk, this box should not be checked until the anesthesia provider confirms that adequate equipment and assistance are available.
</p>
<h2>Does the Patient Have a Risk of > 500 ML Bloo Loss (7 mL/Kg in Children)?</h2>
<p>The checklist coordinator should ask the anethesia team whether loss of half a liter of blood or more is a risk. Significant blood loss is one of the key dangers for surgery patients. The risk of hypovolaemic shock rises when blood loss exceeds 500 mL. Preparation and resuscitation reduces the risk. Surgeons do not alway communicate the risk of blood loss. If the anesthesia provider does not know the risk of major blood loss, he or she should discuss this risk with the surgeon before proceeding.
</p>
<p>If the risk of loss of > 500 mL of blood is significant, WHO recommends at least two large bore IV lines or a central venous catheter be placed before incision. The team should also confirm the available of fluids or blood.
