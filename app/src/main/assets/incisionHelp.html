<h1>SSC: Before Incision</h1>
<p>The Time Out is a pause just before incision to confirm key safety checks. It involves the full team. Full information on implementing the checklist can be found at this <a href ="http://www.who.int/entity/patientsafety/safesurgery/tools_resources/SSSL_Manual_finalJun08.pdf?ua=1">link,</a>
</p>
<h2>Introductions</h2>
<p>
The Time Out requires the team to understand who each member is, and their roles and capabilities. Having each team member introduce themselves addresses this. The checklist coordinator asks each person in the room to introduce him or herself by name and role. Familiar teams can confirm that everyone is introduced, but if new team members are present, this step needs to be completed.
</p>
<h2>Surgeon, Anesthesia Provider, and Nurse Verbally Confirm Patient, Site, and Procedure</h2>
<p>This is the standard Time Out. Prior to incision, the checklist coordinator asks everyone in the room to verbally confirm the patient name, site of surgery, and the procedure to be performed. If appropriate, the patient position should also be verified. This box should not be checked until the surgeon, anesthesia provider, and circulating nurse verbally and individually confirm these items. 
</p>
<h2>Anticipated Critical Events</h2>
<p>The checklist coordinator leads a quick discussion between the surgeon, anesthesia team, and nursing team of key risks and operative plans. Team communication is a key component of safe surgery, and this step is to ensure critical patient issues are known by the entire team. The order of discussion is not important, but the boxes should not be checked until each clinical discipline has given its information. 
</p>
<h2>Surgeon Reviews: What Are the Critical or Unexpected Steps, Operative Duration, Anticipated Blood Loss?</h2>
<p>This discussion is to inform team members of steps that risk rapid blood loss, injury, or other significant problems. Steps requiring special equipment, implants, or preparations should also be shared here.
</p>
<h2>Anesthesia Team Reviews: Are There Any Patient-specific Concerns?</h2>
<p>If the patient is at risk for major blood loss, haemodynamic stability, or other major morbidity, an anesthesia team member should verbally review the specific plans and concerns for resuscitation. This includes the intention to use blood products, as well as complicating comorbidities, such as cardiac disease, blood disorders, etc. Many operations do not entail such risks, so in that event the anesthesia provider can report, "I have no special concerns regarding this case."
</p>
<h2>Nursing Team Reviews: Has Sterility (Including Indicator Results) Been Confirmed? Are There Equipment Issues or Any Concerns?</h2>
<p>The scrub nurse or tech who provides equipment should verbally confirm sterilization was performed, including, for heat sterilized intruments, that the indicator verifies sterility. Any discrepancy between expected and actual sterility results here should be reported to all team members. This is also the time to report equipment problems, preparation issues, or other safety concerns not addressed by the surgeon or anesthesia team. If there are no concerns, the nursing team representaive can report, "Sterility was verified. I have no special concerns."
</p>
<h2>Has Antibiotic Prophylaxis Been Given With the Last 60 Minutes?</h2>
<p>Consistent administeration of antibiotics is a challenge. The checklist coordinator will verbally inquire during the Time Out whether antibiotics have been given in the previous 60 minutes. The responsible team member (usually an anesthesia provider) should verbally confirm. If antibiotics have not been given, they should be administered now. If antibiotics were administered more than 60 minutes prior, the team should consider re-dosing. If no additional dose is given, the box should be left blank. If prophylactic antibiotics are not appropriate, the Not Applicable box should be checked after the team verbally confirms this.
</p>
<h2>Is Essential Imaging Displayed?</h2>
<p>Imaging is necessary to many operations. During the Time Out, the checklist coordinator should confirm with the surgeon whether imaging is needed. If it is required, the coordinator should confirm that the necessary imaging is in the room and prominently displayed. The box should not be checked until this is done. If imaging is necessary, but not available, the surgeon should decide whether to proceed. If imaging is not necessary, the Not Applicable box should be checked.
