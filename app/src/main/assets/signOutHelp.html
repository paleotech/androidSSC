<h1>Before Sign Out</h1>

<p>The Sign Out should be initiated by the circulating nurse, surgeon, or anesthesia provider before the surgeon leaves the room, usually at the time of wound closure. These boxes should be checked only after the checklist coordinator confirms that each items has been addressed by the team. Full information on implementing the checklist can be found at this <a href ="http://www.who.int/entity/patientsafety/safesurgery/tools_resources/SSSL_Manual_finalJun08.pdf?ua=1">link,</a>
</p>
<h2>Nurse Verbally Confirms With The Team: The Procedure Name</h2>
<p>
Procedures can change or expand during the course of surgery. The checklist coordinator should confirm with the surgeon exactly what was done. WHO recommends the question, "What exactly was done?" or the confirmation, "We performed X procedure, correct?"
</p>
<h2>Nurse Verbally Confirms With The Team: Instrument, Sponge, and Needle Counts Are Correct, or Not Applicable</h2>
<p>
Leaving instruments, sponges, or needles in a patient are not common, but it is a persistent problem. The scrub nurse or circulating nurse should verbally confirm the final sponge and needle counts. If there was an open cavity, instrument counts should also be verbally confirmed. If counts are not reconciled, the team should take appropiate steps, such as examining drapes and trash, or obtaining imagery.
</p>
<h2>Nurse Verbally Confirms With The Team: How Is Specimen Labelled?</h2>
<p>
Incorrectly labelled pathological specimens are a frequent source of laboratory error. The cirulating nurse should confirm the labelling of any specimen obtained by verbally stating the patient name, specimen description, and orienting marks.
</p>
<h2>Nurse Verbally Confirms With The Team: Equipment Problems</h2>
<p>
WHO notes, "Equipment problems are universal in operating rooms." Identifying malfunctioning instruments or equipment is necessary to prevent defective devices from remaining in service, to cause problems during future procedures. The checklist coordinator should ensure that any equipment problems found in the case are identified to the team, and appropriate recourse is taken. 
</p>
<h2>Surgeon, Anesthesia Provider, and Nurse Review the Key Concerns for Recovery and Management of This Patient.</h2>
<p>
The surgeon, anesthesia provider, and nurse should review the postoperative recovery and management plan, with a focus on any intraoperative or anesthesic issues that may affect the patient. This is the time to make the entire team aware of events that present a risk to the patient during recovery that may not be evident to everyone. The goal here is efficient and appropriate transfer of critical care information to the whole team.
